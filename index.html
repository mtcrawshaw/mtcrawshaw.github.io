  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at George Mason University
  under Professor Jana Kosecka. My research focuses on multi-task learning and
  meta-learning in computer vision and robotics. Before studying at George Mason, I
  received a B.S. in mathematics and computer science from Ohio State University.</p>

  <p>Generally, I am interested in building machine learning algorithms that can
  transfer knowledge across very wide task distributions, which humans can do to a great
  extent. When a human toddler is learning basic motor control from scratch, they are
  able to learn tasks - such as twisting a door knob and grasping a bottle in hand - in
  a way that allows them to distill fundamental skills from these tasks. These skills
  can be transferred to quickly perform new but related tasks, such as simultaneously
  grasping a bottle and twisting that bottle's cap open. Current machine learning
  methods aren't able to perform such general transfer of knowledge across tasks in
  motor control or any other domain, and my goal is to build systems that can.</p>

  <h2>Current Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Multi-Task Learning and Meta-Learning for Robotic Manipulation: <a
    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10897">Meta-World</a> is a recently proposed
    benchmark suite for multi-task learning and meta-learning within the domain of
    robotic manipulation. Although each of the 50 individual manipulation tasks (open a
    drawer, push an object, etc) are easily solved with an off-the-shelf reinforcement
    learning algorithm such as Soft Actor-Critic, learning the tasks simultaneously with
    a single model or transferring knowledge from previous to unseen tasks has proven a
    challenge for existing methods. I am currently approaching this challenge (both
    multi-task learning and meta-learning benchmarks) with modular neural networks (see
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10166">Modular Meta-Learning</a>) that ease the
    multi-task optimization and allow for compositional generalization through
    recombination of modules.

  <h2>Misc</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In my spare time I like to develop open-source projects to boost productivity,
    including an automatic scheduling tool and a database for managing academic papers.
    Both projects are available at my <a href="https://github.com/mtcrawshaw">GitHub
    page</a>.</li>
    <li>My personal record for the 5000m run is 16:28 (this was in 2014, but I intend to
    be this fast again one day!)</li>
    <li>Mostly, I just want to work on problems that I think are cool and help others do
    the same.</li>
